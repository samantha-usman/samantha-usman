I am an astrophysics PhD candidate at the [University of
Chicago](https://astrophysics.uchicago.edu).

While at [Syracuse University](https://physics.syr.edu) and a [Cardiff
University](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/), my research focused
on analyzinggravitational-wave data from the [Laser Interferometer
Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO)](https://www.ligo.org/).  I'm currently
using spectral data to look at elements found in stars around our
galaxy! I hope to learn more about the formation of heavy elements by
identifying neutron-capture elements in metal-poor stars.  For more details,
head to my [CV page](CV.md).

To learn more about me and what I do for fun (and photos of my dog), head over
to my [About Me page](aboutme.md).

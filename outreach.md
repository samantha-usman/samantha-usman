title: Outreach
---

I'm involved in several outreach programs.  In particular, I am passionate
about increasing awareness and support for LGBT+ scientists.  I am a proud
biromantic asexual (a true space ace) and am working to make UChicago a better
place for queer students.

### UChicago Plus
During the pandemic, I created a messaging group aimed at queer UChicago
students to make connections during lockdown.  The group has now grown into
UChicago Plus, a recognized student group (QGroup) under the Center for
Identity & Inclusion, with approximately 220 members.

### Mentorship
I have mentored five students through the Women in Physics Mentorship Program
and the graduate student mentorship program run by the Physical Sciences
Division's Diversity, Equity and Inclusion office. Mentorship involved checking
on students, giving advice on academic progress and career path, as well as
resources and support for coming out in the workplace.

### LGBT in STEM Recognition Events
I've participated in several events that shined a light on LGBT+ scientists.

#### Out in STEM
Hosted by the Physical Sciences Division's Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
Office, I gave a brief interview and discussed my experiences as a queer
scientist and was highlighted along with other LGBT and ally colleagues.

#### International LGBT+ in STEM Day, 2018
While doing my Masters at Cardiff University, I organized an event celebrating
International LGBT+ in STEM Day. I coordinated with Enfys, the Cardiff
University's LGBT network, to secure funding and location to host a 50-person
event. I also invited two speakers to come and discuss their experiences in the
LGBT community.

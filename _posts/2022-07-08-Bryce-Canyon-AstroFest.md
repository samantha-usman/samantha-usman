I went out to [Bryce Canyon National Park](https://www.nps.gov/brca/index.htm) for their annual [Astronomy Festival](https://www.nps.gov/brca/planyourvisit/astrofest.htm)!

Bryce Canyon is a certified international [Dark Sky Park](https://www.darksky.org/our-work/conservation/idsp/parks/), and boy does it show:

In addition to helping answer visitors' astronomy questions, I also gave my first outreach talk!
In this talk, I did a deep dive into how elements are made! 

tl;dr, light elements can be made inside of stars from fusion! Heavy elements can be made from exploding stars (called *supernova*) or from exotic stars called *neutron stars* crashing into each other!

It's a complicated process, so you can watch me break it down in the video below:
